Cookie Crusade is a Tower Defense game with a twist! You are on the offence, with squadrons of battle-ready gumballs at your disposal. Choose your army and launch waves of attacks to beat the defences of the Gingerbread People!

# What we learned
- Configured a Jenkins pipeline to automatically generate a Unity WebGL build of the game and then deploy it to a website accessible within the local Wi-Fi network.
- Incorporated smoke particle effects that are emitted from a rocket upon launch and when a rocket demolishes a gingerbread house.
- Applied a Breadth First Search algorithm to determine the optimal path for the gumballs to traverse from the starting point to the destination.
- We've recognized that certain gameplay elements, such as level transitions, start screens, and video game tutorials, are consistently employed in each Game Jam project. Therefore, for the upcoming Game Jam, our plan is to pre-develop these components in advance, allowing us to channel our efforts into crafting an enjoyable gaming experience.
