The theme for the 2023 GMTK Game Jam centered around 'Roles Reversed'. Our game reimagines the strategic fun of tower defense games. Instead of assuming the role of a defender, tasked with defeating incoming armies, players take on the offensive role. In our game, you control gumballs and unleash waves of attacks with the goal of reaching a coveted cookie jar while trying to outsmart the gingerbread inhabitants. Furthermore, the game features a whimsical artistic style inspired by the classic board game Candy Land.

# What we learned
- Configured a Jenkins pipeline to automatically generate a Unity WebGL build of the game and then deploy it to a website accessible within the local Wi-Fi network.
- Incorporated smoke particle effects that are emitted from a rocket upon launch and when a rocket demolishes a gingerbread house.
- Applied a Breadth First Search algorithm to determine the optimal path for the gumballs to traverse from the starting point to the destination.
- We've recognized that certain gameplay elements, such as level transitions, start screens, and video game tutorials, are consistently employed in each Game Jam project. Therefore, for the upcoming Game Jam, our plan is to pre-develop these components in advance, allowing us to channel our efforts into crafting an enjoyable gaming experience.
